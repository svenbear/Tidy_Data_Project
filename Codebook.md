#Codebook 

The tidy data set is contained in a file called mean_data.txt.  This file has 88 columns of data.  

Column 1 is called "subject".  It contains values from 1 - 30 that correspond to the person (subject) being tested  

Column 2 is called "activity".  It contains one of the six following activities that the subject is performing
while being measured: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING  

Columns 3 - 88 have  motion data associated with the tests. The names for these columns given in the raw
 data set are terse, but they provide a good description
of the data.  Rather than create long more word-like names for these columns this codebook takes the
approach of using the existing column names and explicitly explaining all terse naming conventions.  
Special characters (eg ".") have been removed from the column names to satisfy the course requirement 
for modifying column names.  These columns all contain mean and standard deviation values.
Below is an explanation of the naming components:  

If the first character of the column name is a "t" then the column has time data.  The units for
these columns are seconds.  
  
If the first character is an "f" then this value is the result of a fast fourier transform performed on the
associated "t" value  (eg fBodyAccmeanX is the result of a fast fourier transform performed on tBodyAccmeanX).
Fast fourier transforms were only performed on a subset of the "t" values so there is not a one to one correspondence
between "t" values and "f" values.  The units for these columns are frequency 

mean = average  
  
std = standard deviation  (All of these columns are either mean or std values, so each columname will 
have either mean or std in its name)

acc = acceleration  

gyro = gyroscope  

mag = magnitude  

freq = frequency  

gravity = acceleration due to gravity   

jerk = jerking motion  

body = full body measurement  


X = 3 dimensional X direction  

Y = 3 dimensional Y direction  

Z = 3 dimensional Z direction  

angle = signifies a measurement of the angle between vectors.  Columns with angle will not have
"t" or "f" as the first character.  Some columns with angle have a "t" embedded just after the term angle

#Additional note on the measurement data  
The values shown in columns 3 - 88 are the average of several observations (rows) from the raw data for a given subject/activity.
So for example if there are 95 rows in the raw data for subject1//activity 1, the output in the final tidy data set for
each of the motion measurements is the sum of the value for the 95 rows divided by 95.
